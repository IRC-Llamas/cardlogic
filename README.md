# CardLogic
Library for handling custom card game rules, starting with poker, and with the potential for any alternative versions of poker, custom rules and plugins, or completely different card games.
This library is meant as a starting point for implementing your own front-end on top of it, easing the process of writing your card game.
Please see [this](https://github.com/IRC-Llamas/cardlogic/discussions/31) introductory announcement for more details.
